    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <img src="download.jpeg" alt="about">
    <P>In a world that often confuses volume with power, Grace stands as a silent storm — calm on the surface but with a depth of strength that anchors everyone around her. She is the kind of person who enters a room without demanding attention, yet somehow, everyone notices. Not because she speaks loudly or moves with dramatic flair, but because she carries herself with quiet confidence and unshakable grace.

Physically, Grace is unassuming. She is of average height with soft, warm eyes the color of morning coffee — comforting, familiar, and deep. Her hair, a mass of natural curls, is rarely tamed, yet it suits her personality: free, authentic, and quietly defiant of expectations. There is always a gentle smile playing at the corners of her lips, the kind that makes people feel seen and heard.

But what makes Grace remarkable is not what she looks like; it’s who she is. She listens more than she speaks, and when she does speak, her words are thoughtful, often insightful, and always kind. There is a sincerity to her that draws people in — they tell her their stories, their worries, their dreams. She never judges, only listens with a presence that makes you feel like you matter. She makes space for others in a world that often tries to crowd them out.</P>
